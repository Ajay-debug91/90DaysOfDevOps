1. What is DevOps? (The Process)
   
DevOps is a cultural approach and a set of practices that bridges the gap between software developers (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).

DevOps is the practice of building, deploying, monitoring, and fixing software reliably by combining development and operations skills. 

2. My Current Level

I am a working professional (Java Developer) with around 1.5+ years of experience and 4 java Support . I have basic Linux knowledge and development background, and I am now 

transitioning toward a DevOps Engineer role.


Goal: To deliver software faster, more frequently, and with fewer errors.

Key Concept: Automation. It removes manual steps in testing, building, and deploying code. 

3. What is Cloud Engineering?
   
Cloud Engineering focuses on designing, building, and managing the infrastructure on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

Goal: To ensure the environment is secure, scalable, and cost-effective.

Key Concept: Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Using code to set up servers instead of manually clicking buttons. 

4. Key Differences
   

Feature 	             DevOps Engineer	                               Cloud Engineer

Focus	                 Software Delivery Process (Pipeline)	           Infrastructure & Environment

Main Goal	             Speed, Reliability, Automation	                 Security, Scalability, Cost

Tools	                 Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes  	 AWS, Azure, GCP, Terraform

Analogy	               The "Assembly Line" Operator	                   The "Factory Floor" Builder

5. How They Work Together (The Real-World Scenario)

   
In modern companies, these roles overlap heavily (often called "Cloud DevOps"). 

The Scenario: A company needs to launch a new app update.

Cloud Engineer's Role: Uses Terraform to create a secure, scalable virtual server environment on AWS (e.g., EC2 instances).

DevOps Engineer's Role: Uses Jenkins to build a pipeline that automatically pulls the new code, tests it, and deploys it onto the servers the Cloud Engineer created. 

Conclusion: The Cloud Engineer builds the house, and the DevOps Engineer builds the automated, fast-moving assembly line inside that house.



Where do you want to reach?

“I want to grow as an engineer while building a stable, comfortable, and happy life for my family.”

job-ready for a junior/mid-level DevOps role with hands-on proof



How you will stay consistent every single day?

“I will stay consistent by setting small daily goals, following a routine, and improving a little every day without giving up.”

Study and practice at the same fixed time daily

Focus on hands-on labs over theory

Maintain notes and tasks in GitHub

Track progress weekly and adjust, not quit



Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?

Learning DevOps and Cloud is widely considered a top career move in 2026 because it combines high demand, high salaries, and future-proof skills. In short, it is the modern

way to build, deploy, and manage software faster and more reliably. 


My 3 Clear Goals for the Next 90 Days

Deploy a production-style application on a Linux server with proper logs and monitoring

Build a CI/CD pipeline to automate build and deployment

Containerize and deploy an application using Docker & Kubernetes basics


Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud

I want to move from only writing code to owning applications in production

DevOps skills are highly in demand and align with real-world engineering problems

I want a career with continuous learning, problem-solving, and impact



3 Core DevOps Skills I Will Build

Linux Troubleshooting & System Fundamentals (processes, services, logs, networking)

CI/CD & Automation (Git, pipelines, scripting)

Containers & Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes basics)


Weekly Time Commitment (Realistic Plan)

Weekdays: 2–2.5 hours per day (learning + hands-on practice)

Weekends: 6–8 hours (live class projects, revision, troubleshooting)

Total: ~15–18 hours per week



Final Commitment

I will prioritize consistency over perfection. Even small daily progress, repeated for 90 days, will compound into real DevOps skills and confidence.
