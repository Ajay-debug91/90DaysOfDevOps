Key Linux Directory Structure:

/ (Root): The top-level directory, containing all files and directories.

What it contains: The top-level directory. Every file and folder in Linux starts here.

I would use this when… I need to understand the overall structure of the system or locate a major directory.
Example ls -l / output (varies by system):


/bin & /usr/bin: Essential command binaries and executable files (e.g., ls, cd).
What it contains: Essential system commands required for booting and basic operation.
I would use this when… I want to know where basic Linux commands live or troubleshoot minimal systems.
ls -l /bin


/sbin & /usr/sbin: System binaries for administrative tasks, usually for the root user.
What it contains: User-level commands and applications (non-essential for boot).
I would use this when… I am checking installed software or command availability for users.
ls -l /usr/bin


/etc: System-wide configuration files for applications and system services.
What it contains: System-wide configuration files for services and applications.
I would use this when… I need to configure or troubleshoot services like SSH, Nginx, Docker, or users.
ls -l /etc


/home: User home directories for storing personal files.

What it contains: Home directories for normal users. Each user gets their own folder here.

I would use this when… I am managing user files, permissions, or user-specific application data.
ls -l /home



/root: The home directory for the root user (system administrator).
What it contains: Home directory of the root (admin) user.
I would use this when… I am logged in as root and need access to admin-only configuration or scripts.
ls -l /root


/var: Variable data files, including system logs, mail, and print queues.
/var/log

What it contains: Log files generated by the system and services.
I would use this when… An application or service is failing and I need error details or history (very common in DevOps).
ls -l /var/log



/usr: User programs, libraries, and documentation.

/dev: Device files representing hardware devices (e.g., /dev/sda).

/boot: Files required for the boot process, including the kernel.

/lib & /lib64: Essential shared libraries for binaries in /bin and /sbin.

/tmp: Temporary files, often cleared upon reboot.
What it contains: Temporary files created by applications and users. Files may be deleted on reboot.
I would use this when… I need short-lived storage for testing, scripts, or intermediate files.
ls -l /tmp


/opt: Optional or third-party software packages.
What it contains: Optional or third-party software installed manually.
I would use this when… I install or manage custom applications outside the system package manager.
ls -l /opt

/mnt & /media: Mount points for temporary or removable storage devices. 

This structure ensures consistency across different Linux distributions.

Real-World Scenarios and Step-by-Step Solutions





Scenario 1: Troubleshooting a Full Disk

Problem: The server is slow, and applications are failing to start. You suspect the disk is full. 

Check disk usage: Run df -h to find which partition is 100% full.

Investigate logs: If /var is full, check logs.

Command: cd /var/log

Command: du -sh * (To find the largest log file).

Clear space: Safely truncate a log file instead of deleting it.

Command: truncate -s 0 /var/log/syslog (Reduces file to 0 bytes without deleting). 






Scenario 2: Configuring a New User

Problem: A new user named jdoe needs to be added to the system.

Create user: Use the system command in /usr/sbin.

Command: sudo useradd -m jdoe

Verify home directory: Check that the user has a directory in /home.

Command: ls /home/jdoe

Set password: Use passwd to secure the new account. 





Scenario 3: Changing System Network Settings

Problem: You need to change the IP address for the server. 

Locate config: In modern Linux, network configuration is in /etc/netplan or /etc/network/interfaces.

Edit file: Use a text editor like vi or nano to edit the network config file inside /etc.

Command: sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml

Apply changes: Apply settings with sudo netplan apply. 





Scenario 4: Mounting a New USB Drive 

Problem: A USB drive is plugged in, but you cannot access the files. 

Identify device: Locate the device name in /dev.

Command: lsblk (e.g., /dev/sdb1).

Create Mount Point: Create a directory in /mnt or /media.

Command: sudo mkdir /mnt/usb

Mount: Mount the device to the directory.

Command: sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb 





Scenario 5: Installing Third-Party Software

Problem: You downloaded a pre-compiled software package (not via a repository) and need to install it securely. 

Move to Location: Place the application in /opt.

Command: sudo mv software_folder /opt/

Add to Path: Add /opt/software_folder/bin to your $PATH to run the command from anywhere. 





Scenario 6: Reviewing Kernel Errors

Problem: A hardware device is not working, and you need to check kernel messages. 

Access Kernel Info: Go to the virtual filesystem /proc.

Command: cat /proc/cpuinfo (View CPU info) or dmesg (Check boot/hardware logs).

Alternative: View log messages.

Command: cat /var/log/dmesg
